# QuillTrainingCharity
A repository to store WEB701 project work on a fictitious charity project.

Starting The Application
Upon cloning or download of the project I suggest that you use the following npm command in the project directory as well as the frontend directory.

`npm install`

Once that is done you can use the following commands in the root directory of each stack. <br> 
`npm start` launches the backend of the application <br> 
`npm run client` launches the frontend <br> 
`npm run dev` launches the full application <br>
